      <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
      <p>
        When we decompose a complex problem we often find patterns among the
        smaller problems we create. The patterns are similarities or
        characteristics that some of the problems share. <br />
        <br />

        Pattern recognition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science.
        It involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed
        problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently.
