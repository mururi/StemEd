                    <p>Humans and animals, as well as plants and trees, contain many different functional organs and tissues. These, in turn, are composed of a large variety of cells. Cells are therefore the basic building blocks which make up the organism.
                        All animal cells have a similar structure: an outer layer called the plasma membrane, made up of a double layer of lipid molecules, and an inner fluid known as cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contains a variety of small structures called
                        organelles, each of which has a specific and essential function within the cell. Most cell organelles are themselves separated from the cytoplasm by their own membranes. The form of the cell is determined and supported by the cytoskeleton,
                        a flexible scaffolding composed of polymers of protein molecules which form a network that shapes the cell and allows it to move and “walk”. Inside the cell countless proteins e sometimes in cooperation with RNA molecules e facilitate
                        the chemical and physical reactions and transport of other molecules required to carry out specific cellular functions. The most prominent organelle viewed under the microscope is the nucleus. This contains the chromosomes, which
                        are in part made up of DNA one long molecule of DNA per chromosome - representing the <img src="./images/animal cell.png" alt=""><br><br> organism’s blueprint. Although cells can have different shapes and functions, the DNA sequence
                        in all cells of a given individual is in principle identical (with the exception of certain blood cells). Other prominent structures in the cell are the mitochondria. These organelles are present in large numbers and generate the
                        energy required by the cell. Cells with very large energy requirements, like heart cells, contain correspondingly higher numbers of mitochondria. Energy is also required, among other things, for creating messenger RNA (mRNA) and
                        linking amino acids to each other in the ribosomes to form proteins. Rudimental proteins thus made are delivered to the tubular structures of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are processed into actual working proteins in yet
                        another organelle, the Golgi apparatus. They are then transported in small vesicles, termed vacuoles, to the site in the cell where they are required to exert their own specific function. Each cell is thus a highly dynamic structure
                        with its own powerhouse, factories and transport systems.
