      <h4>Abstraction</h4>
      <p>
        In computational thinking, when we decompose problems, we then look for
        patterns among and within the smaller problems that make up the complex
        problem. Abstraction is the process of filtering out â€“ ignoring - the
        characteristics of patterns <br />
        that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is
        also the filtering out of specific details. From this we create a
        representation (idea) of what we are trying to solve. <br />
        <br />

        What are specific details or characteristics? In pattern recognition we
        looked at the problem of having to draw a series of cats. <br />
        <br />

        We noted that all cats have general characteristics, which are common to
        all cats, eg eyes, a tail, fur, a liking for fish and the ability to
        make meowing sounds. In addition, each cat has specific characteristics,
        such as black fur, a long tail, green eyes, a love of salmon, and a loud
        meow. These details are known as specifics. <br /><br />

        In order to draw a basic cat, we do need to know that it has a tail, fur
        and eyes. These characteristics are relevant. We don't need to know what
        sound a cat makes or that it likes fish. <br />
        <br />
        These characteristics are irrelevant and can be filtered out. We do need
        to know that a cat has a tail, fur and eyes, but we don't need to know
        what size and colour these are. These specifics can be filtered out.
        From the general characteristics we have (tail, fur, eyes) we can build
        a basic idea of a cat, ie what a cat basically looks like . Once we know
        what a cat looks like we can describe how to draw a basic cat.
