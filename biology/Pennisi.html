                    <p>How a single cell made the leap to a complex organism is one of life’s great mysteries. Biologists have thought that new genes and gene networks would be needed to make possible the move to multicellularity. But, at least in green
                        algae, that turns out not to be the case. On page 223, a comparison between the genomes of the 2000-cell Volvox carteri and a single-celled green alga, Chlamydomo- nas reinhardtii, has revealed surprisingly few differences in their
                        gene makeup. “Even major evolutionary transitions can be accomplished via relatively subtle genetic changes,” says David Kirk, a developmental biologist at Washington University in St. Louis. As a result, solving this mystery “is
                        going to take a lot more work.” Ever since the Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered a multicellular Volvox in 1700, biologists have thought it would be a good model for studying how complex organisms arose. It
                        belongs to a group that includes single-celled and multicellular species of varying degrees of complexity. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, for example, is a single cell powered by two ﬂagella that lives in soil and fresh water. By contrast,
                        Volvox carteri, which is found in temporary and permanent ponds, has a much more complex life cycle. Adults consist of 2000 lagellated cells embedded in a spherical extracellular matrix, with 16 larger germ cells inside. Germ cells
                        give rise to embryos in which dividing cells remain connected by cytoplasmic bridges from one cell interior to another, forming a hollow ball. At ﬁrst all of the embryo’s ﬂagella face inward, but soon the newly formed embryo turns
                        itself inside out, putting the flagella on the outside. Now called juveniles, these balls begin expanding by adding to their extra- cellular matrix and eventually burst out of the parental sphere. Soon after the juveniles leave
                        the sphere, the rest of the cells die. In 2005, James Umen, a cell and developmental biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, teamed up with Simon Prochnik and Daniel Rokhsar of the U.S.
                        Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in Walnut Creek, California, and others to sequence the Volvox genome. JGI had already deci- phered the genome of the single-celled Chlamydomonas. The 138-million-base Volvox genome
                        proved to be 17% bigger than the Chlamy- domonas genome, but not because of new genes. Instead, it contained more repeti- tive DNA, Prochnik, Umen, Rokhsar, and their colleagues report. Moreover, it has roughly the same number
                        of genes—about 14,500—as Chlamydomonas. The researchers found few, if any, Volvox genes coding for novel proteins or protein subunits that could account for the difference in morphology between the two species. The gene networks
                        that likely underlie the cytoplasmic bridges, the inversion of the sphere, and asymmetric cell division were quite similar in Stanford, California.
                        <br>“The findings suggest that it doesn’t take very large changes in gene content to transition from a single-cell to a multicellular lifestyle.” He suspects that some genes have altered their function in Volvox to account for
                        the changes, and he calls for a more in-depth look for small changes in gene and protein—sequence. The findings parallel what Nicole King of the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues saw when they compared the
                        genomes of a choanolagellatea close single-celled relative to animals and several animals. The choanolagellate had protein subunits, or domains, previously thought to be unique to metazoans, leading her to conclude that multicellularity
                        in that part of the tree of life arose not so much from new genes but from a shuffling and recombining of existing genes and parts of genes.
