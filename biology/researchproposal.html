                    <h2 style="padding: 20px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">STEM CELLS -RESEARCH PROPOSAL</h2>
                    <p>The primary mode of dissemination of scientific discovery is through written research articles and the primary source of funds for doing science is through writing grant proposals. Science writing is somewhat different than writing
                        papers in other disciplines and becoming a skilled science writer requires practice, feedback, and determination. You will not become a skilled science writer overnight but hopefully you have had several science courses by now
                        that have asked you to do some science writing. This assignment is designed to build upon your basic science writing skills while simultaneously forcing you to think creatively about the science behind stem cell biology. The goal
                        is to review the literature on a topic of your choice and discern what is known and what is not known about your topic. Based on this identify an important scientific question and write a ~6 page research proposal that addresses
                        why this question is important and how you propose to go about answering it. A rubric is provided below
                    </p>
                    <p>*<b>Suggestion</b>: consider choosing a topic for your research proposal that overlaps with the topic for your student-led discussion. This will allow you to survey the same body of literature with two purposes in mind. Furthermore,
                        you will finish the course with a very comprehensive understanding of various aspects of stem cell biology with respect to one particular type of stem cell. One might argue that such an experience is more worthwhile that a broader
                        but shallower understanding of stem cells in general. But, it is your choice; be sure to choose a topic that you will be interested in.</p>
                    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Get Started....</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Identify an original research question on any topic related to stem cell biology.</b>:ou may wish to identify genes that serve as markers for the specific stem cell type that you choose. You may wish to determine the set of
                            factors that are needed to promote differentiation of a specific stem cell into a specific type of daughter cell. There may be unknown factors involved in stem cell maintenance via a stem cell niche interaction and you may
                            propose to identify and characterize those factors. Stem cells often have asymmetric cell divisions that are governed by the cytoskeleton and factors that regulate it; you may propose to investigate this for any given stem
                            cell type. Alternatively you may focus on the application of stem cells for medical purposes such as the treatment of a disease or injury with stem cells. In this case be sure that you are focused on a new or novel technique
                            or application. Do your homework and be sure that you are proposing an original question, not a question that has already been adequately researched. I much prefer that you identify a specific and focused question rather than
                            a broad and vague question. I do not care if your proposal is very simple; a simple proposal often is advantageous because there are often specific and focused experiments that can address it.</li>
                        <li><b>Think about the best possible experiments that can be used to answer your question.</b>: There are no points or prizes for designing the most elaborate or complex experiment. Rather, you will be critically evaluated on your
                            ability to match the appropriate experiment to the scientific question of interest. Price is no object; so do not be concerned if your planned experiments use expensive reagents or procedures. Likewise, the timeframe needed
                            for completing the experiment is also irrelevant for our purposes so long-term studies are fair game.</li>
                        <li><b>First Draft.</b>: The draft will not be graded; but it is mandatory that you submit a draft. The purpose of the draft is for you to get feedback from me and from two of your classmates. You may not have a polished draft but
                            you should at the very least have a well-defined question, an experimental strategy, and some language that gives the reader a sense of why the question is important. The more complete the draft, the more helpful the feedback
                            will be.</li>
                        <li><b>Peer reviews.</b>: See below for a peer-evaluation form. Simply complete the form for the two drafts that you are assigned and I will pass along your comments anonymously to the authors. You will also receive my comments on
                            your proposal.</li>
