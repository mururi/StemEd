      <h4>Decomposition</h4>
      <p>
        Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science.
        <br />
        it involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts
        that are more manageable and easier to understand. <br />
        The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed
        individually, as they are simpler to work with.
      </p>

      <h4>Why decomposition is important</h4>
      <p>
        If a problem is not decomposed, it is much harder to solve. Dealing with
        many different stages all at once is much more difficult than breaking a
        problem down into a number of smaller problems and solving each one, one
        at a time. Breaking the problem down into smaller parts means that each
        smaller problem can be examined in more detail.
