          And what is computational thinking you'd ask, <br />thought you'd

        <p>
          It’s the process of breaking down a problem into <br> simple enough steps
          that even a computer would <br> understand. We all know that computers take <br>
          instructions very literally, sometimes to comic results. <br> If we don’t
          provide computers with instructions that are <br> precise and detailed,
          your algorithm might forget vital actions that most people take for
          granted.

        <h4>Thinking Computationally</h4>
        <p>
          Thinking computationally is not programming.  It is not even thinking like a
          
          computer, <br>  as computers do not, and cannot, think. <br> <br>

          Simply put, programming tells a computer what to do and how to do it.
           Computational thinking enables  <br> <br> you to work out exactly what to tell the computer to do.
          
          For example, if you agree to meet your friends somewhere you have never been before, you would probably 
          plan your route before you step out of your house. You might consider the routes available and which 
          route is ‘best’ - this might be the route that is the shortest, the quickest, or the one which goes 
          past your favourite shop on the way. <br> <br> You'd then follow the step-by-step directions to get 
          there. In this case, the planning part is like computational thinking, and following the directions
           is like programming.
          
          Being able to turn a complex problem into one we can easily understand is a skill that is extremely
           useful. In fact, it's a skill you already have and probably use every day.
          
          For example, it might be that you need to decide what to do with your group of friends.
           If all of you like different things, you would need to decide:
          
          <ul>
            <li>what you could do</li>
            <li>where you could go</li>
            <li>who wants to do what</li>
            <li>what you have previously done that has been a success in the past</li>
            <li>how much money you have and the cost of any of the op</li>
            <li>what the weather might be doing</li>
            <li>how much time you have</li>
          </ul>
          Another example might occur when playing a videogame. Depending on the game,
           in order to complete a level you would need to know:
          
          what items you need to collect, how you can collect them, and how long you have in which to collect them
          where the exit is and the best route to reach it in the quickest time possible
          what kinds of enemies there are and their weak points
          From these details you can work out a strategy for completing the level in the most efficient way.
          
          If you were to create your own computer game, these are exactly the types of questions 
          you would need to think about and answer before you were able to program your game.

        <h4>Algorithms</h4>
        In an algorithm, each instruction is identified and the order
         in which they should be carried out is planned. Algorithms 
         are often used as a starting point for creating a computer program, 
         and they are sometimes written as a flowchart or in pseudocode.

If we want to tell a computer to do something, we have to write a <br>
 computer program that will tell the computer, step-by-step, exactly what
  we want it to do and how we want it to do it. This step-by-step p
 rogram will need planning, and to do this we use an algorithm. <br> <br>

Computers are only as good as the algorithms they are given. 
If you give a computer a poor algorithm, you will get a poor 
result – hence the phrase: ‘Garbage in, garbage out.’ <br> <br>

Algorithms are used for many different things including 
calculations, data processing and automation.
