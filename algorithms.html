      <h4>Algorithms</h4>
      In an algorithm, each instruction is identified and the order in which
      they should be carried out is planned. <br />
      <br />
      Algorithms are often used as a starting point for creating a computer
      program, and they are sometimes written as a flowchart or in pseudocode.
      If we want to tell a computer to do something, we have to write a <br />
      computer program that will tell the computer, step-by-step, exactly what
      we want it to do and how we want it to do it. This step-by-step p rogram
      will need planning, and to do this we use an algorithm. <br />
      <br />

      Computers are only as good as the algorithms they are given. If you give a
      computer a poor algorithm, you will get a poor result – hence the phrase:
      ‘Garbage in, garbage out.’ <br />
      <br />

      Algorithms are used for many different things including calculations, data
      processing and automation.
